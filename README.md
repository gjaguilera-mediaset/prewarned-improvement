# Node Typescript Starter

This project contains a minimal starter for Node.js project with Typescript, ESLint and Prettier

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+
- Yarn or NPM

## Installation
- Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
- We need to add the corresponding jsons to their respective folders:
    - `prewarmed`: Files with the prewarmed tags
    - `pre-prewarmed`: Files from previous prewarmed implementation.


- Start Application (Running once)
```bash
npm run start:once
```

- Start Application (Hot-Reload mode)
```bash
npm start
```
The application will be launched by [Nodemon](https://nodemon.com) so it's will restart automatically on file change
